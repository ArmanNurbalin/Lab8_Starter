Graceful Degradation:
Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related because service workers help maintain core functionality even when advanced features fail or the network is unavailable. With graceful degradation, we build the full experience first, then ensure that when any of those fail, the app still works in a reduced but usable form. Service workers support this by caching essential resources and intercepting network requests so users can access content offline or under poor conditions, thereby degrading the experience gracefully rather than breaking it entirely.
